\title{Calculate adjustments for library size}
\usage{
sampleDepth(collapsedFull, probs = c(0.5, 1), scalefac = 32, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{collapsedFull}{The full coverage data collapsed by sample as produced
by \link{collapseFullCoverage}.}

\item{probs}{Number(s) between 0 and 1 representing the quantile(s) of
interest. For example, 0.5 is the median.}

\item{scalefac}{Number added to the sample coverage adjustments before the
log2 transformation.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to other methods and/or advanced arguments.}
}
\value{
A matrix (vector of \code{length(probs) == 1}) with the library size depth
adjustments per sample to be used in \link{makeModels}. The number of rows
corresponds to the number of quantiles used for the sample adjustments.
}
\description{
For a given data set calculate the per-sample coverage adjustments. Hector
Corrada's group proposed calculating the sum of the coverage for genes below
a given sample quantile. In this function, we calculate the sample quantiles
of interest by sample, and then the sum of the coverage for bases below or
equal to quantiles of interest. The resulting values are transformed {log2(x
+ scalefac)} to avoid very large numbers that could potentially affect the
stability of the F-statistics calculation. The sample coverage adjustments
are then used in \link{makeModels} for construcing the null and alternative
models.

\examples{
## Collapse the coverage information
collapsedFull <- collapseFullCoverage(list(genomeData$coverage),
    verbose=TRUE)

## Calculate library size adjustments
sampleDepths <- sampleDepth(collapsedFull, probs=c(0.5, 1), verbose=TRUE)
